# KHInsiderScraper

Web Scraper for KHInsider

## How does this work?

1. Download this repository
2. Run `yarn`
3. Grab the last part of the OST link you want to download (e.g. https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/bomberman-2-nintendo-ds => bomberman-2-nintendo-ds)
4. Run `node . bomberman-2-nintendo-ds`
5. A `results` directory will be created with the OST inside

## Motivation

I love to listen to soundtracks on KHInsider, and it takes time to download tracks one at a time, this is why I did this tool. I also did it to learn to use Puppeteer. ðŸ™ƒ
